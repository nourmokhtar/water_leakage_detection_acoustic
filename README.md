This project presents a deep learning-based water leak detection system using acoustic spectrograms. The model, a 4-layer CNN trained with focal loss and regularization techniques, achieves 98.7% accuracy on real-world and augmented datasets. It addresses class imbalance, prevents overfitting, and ensures robust, reliable leak detection



 Data Sources
Mendeley Dataset

Acoustic Leak Detection Dataset from Mendeley

Contains labeled audio recordings (.wav format) of "leak" and "no leak" scenarios from various pipeline conditions.

YouTube Audio Scraping

Collected additional real-world leakage sounds by scraping YouTube videos using Python scripts to increase diversity and realism.
